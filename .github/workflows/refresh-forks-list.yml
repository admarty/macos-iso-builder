          ## How to Use This List
          
          1. Sign in to your GitHub account https://github.com/login
          2. Browse links in the list below to find the image you need
          3. Click on a successful workflow runs (green checkmark)
          4. Scroll down to **Artifacts** section to download it
          
          <details>
          <summary>⚠️ Do NOT click this. Seriously.</summary>
          <details>
          <summary>⚠️ DO NOT CLICK. LAST WARNING.</summary>
          <br>
          You clicked anyway. Typical.<br>

          This workflow just performed mass-scale **forbidden Apple sorcery** that Cupertino pretends doesn't exist.

          **What you got (for free, like a thief):**
          - ✅ A legit macOS installer
          - ✅ 3+ hours not wasted on broken torrents
          - ✅ Zero shady downloads
          - ✅ Something that actually works

          Whatever you do, **DO NOT** [⭐ star this repo](https://github.com/LongQT-sea/macos-iso-builder).
          ![star](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LongQT-sea/mkmaciso/main/.github/star.png)

          Seriously. Don't do it. Don't help other people find this. I'm sure you won't anyway. Nobody ever does.

          *(...unless you're the kind of person who does the opposite of what they're told)*

          ### Can't Find What You Need?
          
          If none of the recent forks have the macOS version you need:
          1. [Fork this repository](../../fork)
          2. Follow the [Usage Guide](../../#usage-guide) to build your own image
          3. Your fork will appear here for others to benefit from!
